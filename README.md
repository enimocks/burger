# burger
In this assignment, we are creating a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. Following the MVC design pattern, using Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate HTML -- this app lets users enter the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
